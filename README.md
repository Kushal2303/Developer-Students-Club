### About Projects:

1) 'Pricing Panel' is my latest project where I used most of everything I know about HTML and CSS.
2) 'Hover Button' was just me playing around and learning how to use different CSS properties to... well, make a fancy button.
3) 'Photo Site' is one of my first projects, so it's really just a simple 3x3 picture grid made before I knew what flexbox was.

### About Me:
Hi! My name is Kushal Mishra and I am a first year (now second?) Computer Science student at BITS Hyderabad. I started learning Web Development only very recently (~1 month). So far I am comfortable with HTML and CSS. At the time of writing this, I am learning Bootstrap and will soon begin JavaScript.
